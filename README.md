Swimming Lane
=============

A co-worker showed my some diagrams he created by hand. It is a kind
of flow diagram he uses to get a feel for the overal flow of an
application. With these diagrams one is able to reason about a process
from a higher level.

Although the diagrams are extremely valuable, they are labor
intensive and hard to maintain. Because of this they are not as
ubiquitous as they should be.

In order to bridge that gap this project is started.

Goals
-----

The goals for this project are stated below.

Create

* a [Domain Specific
  Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
  "Wikipedia on DSL's") (DSL) which describes swimming lanes.
* a rich object model which models swimming lanes.
* various views which display the modeled swimming lanes.

Environment
-----------

### Ruby

We will be using 
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "Homepage of Ruby Programming Language")
and the Ruby Version Manager 
([rvm](http://beginrescueend.com/ "Homepage of rvm")). We are working
in with a gemset to contain the influence of installed gems. Our setup
is detailed below.

    > rvm use 1.9.2
    > rvm gemset create swim-lane

Whenever we work on the project we issue the following command

    > rvm use 1.9.2@swim-lane

### Bundler

We are using 
[bundler](http://gembundler.com/ "Homepage for bundler")
to manage our applications dependencies. It can be installed with the
following command

    > gem install bundler

### Gem

We try to follow the project structure as detailed by a RubyGem
[manual](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/24 "Structure of gem")

    swimlane/
    |-- lib/
    |   |-- swimlane.rb  
    |   |-- swimlane/
    |   |   |-- source1.rb
    |   |   |-- source2.rb
    |-- test/
    |-- README.md
    |-- Rakefile
    |-- gem.gemspec

This allows us to eventually create a gem from this project.
